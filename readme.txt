Add a donation button to any page on your website. Easy & fast setup. Works with Mollie payments.

== Description ==

*Kudos Donations* allows you to add a donate button anywhere on your website. Once a user clicks this button they will be greeted
with a configurable pop-up window, where they can enter their details and how much they would like to donate.

Buttons can be placed either using the provided 'Kudos Button' block or using a shortcode:

`
//Customise button text
[kudos button="Help us out!"]

//Customise header text
[kudos header="Support our cause"]

//Customise message text
[kudos text="Thank you for donating to this project. We really appreciate your support."]

//A fully customised button and text would look like this
[kudos label="Help us out!" header="Support our cause" text="Thank you for donating to this project. We really appreciate your support."]
