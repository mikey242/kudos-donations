= How do I use the shortcode? =

There is a handy "Copy shortcode" button at the top and bottom of the campaign edit screen that will copy the shortcode into your clipboard.

To get started add the Kudos Donations shortcode:

~~~
[kudos campaign_id="242"]
~~~

Here is a list of the shortcode attributes:

* *button_label* = The label to display for the button.
* *campaign_id* = ID of the campaign to use for this button.
* *type* = Whether to show as a button with pop-up or just the form. Can be "button" or "form".

e.g:

~~~~
[kudos button_label="Donate now" campaign_id="default"]
~~~~

For general information on how to use shortcodes, please visit [this page](https://codex.wordpress.org/shortcode).

= The donation modal (pop-up) does not appear correctly. =

This can occur as a result of a conflict with your theme or another plugin and the solution can be different for each website. A quick and easy fix to try is to enable the "Modal in footer" option under the help tab in settings.
